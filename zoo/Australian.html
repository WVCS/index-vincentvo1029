    Australian Animals
    
  </h3>
  <h1> Australian Animals </h1>
    <p> They're spooky, toxic, dangerous, hazardous, and an all-around deterrent yet the people of Australia are still crazy enough to call their little floating rock "home sweet home." Why don't we take a look and see what sort of horrors Australians have to put up with on a daily basis? </p>
    <p> Okay, ignoring the intro paragraph, carpet pythons pose little to no danger to humans. They're even popular enough to be kept as pets! Their bites will hurt (like most nonvenomous snake bites will) but as they're small constrictors, a knowledgable person will have no problem bypassing this issue. </p>

      <p> NOW we get into the fun stuff: the animals that can actually kill you that have made Australia so infamous. Introducing the cassowary, a giant flightless dinosaur bird thing that's got a razor-sharp beak, raking claws, can swim, leap 7 feet off the ground, and expert running ability! Luckily for everyone involved, the cassowary's favorite food is not man flesh but fruit but agitating these animals is not recommended. Or just crossing paths with one, really. </p>

<p> Sharks! The great predators and wolves of the open seas. Everyone knows or has at least heard of the infamous great white shark. And multiple reportings of great whites being seen in Australian waters have been documented! These fearsome beats remain mostly mysterious but science can answer to one of its favorite prey items: seals. Great whites can also not be kept in captivity so go on a whale watch and hope for the best! </p>
